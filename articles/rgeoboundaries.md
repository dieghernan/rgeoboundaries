# rgeoboundaries: A Client for the geoBoundaries Administrative Boundaries Dataset

[**Attribution**](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#usage) **is
required when using geoBoundaries.**

## Introduction

The **rgeoboundaries** package provides a straightforward interface for
downloading and working with global political and administrative
boundary data from the [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/)
project ([Runfola et al. 2020](#ref-geoboundaries)).

These datasets are openly licensed ([CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) and cover countries
worldwide across multiple administrative levels. With
**rgeoboundaries**, you can easily fetch boundary geometries as **sf**
objects, explore metadata, cache datasets locally, and seamlessly
integrate the boundaries into your spatial workflows.

## Understanding the data

The geoBoundaries database undergoes a rigorous quality assurance
process, including manual review and hand-digitization of physical maps
where necessary. Its primary goal is to provide the highest possible
level of spatial accuracy for scientific and academic applications.

This precision comes at a cost: some files can be quite large and may
take longer to download. For visualization or general mapping purposes,
we recommend using the simplified datasets available by setting
`simplified = TRUE`.

``` r
library(rgeoboundaries)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Different resolutions
norway <- gb_get_adm0("NOR") %>%
  mutate(res = "Full resolution")
print(object.size(norway), units = "Mb")
#> 26.5 Mb

norway_simp <- gb_get_adm0(country = "NOR", simplified = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(res = "Simplified")
print(object.size(norway_simp), units = "Mb")
#> 1.5 Mb

norway_all <- bind_rows(norway, norway_simp)

# Plot ggplot2
ggplot(norway_all) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#BA0C2F", color = "#00205B") +
  facet_wrap(vars(res)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(caption = "Source: www.geoboundaries.org")
```

### Individual country files

The geoBoundaries API provides [individual country
files](https://www.geoboundaries.org/countryDownloads.html), whose aim
is to represent every nation “as they would represent themselves”, with
no special identification of disputed areas.

The download of this data is implemented in
[`gb_get()`](../reference/gb_get.md) and the `gb_get_adm` family of
functions. It is not guaranteed that borders align perfectly or that
there are no gaps between countries. Additionally, these files do not
include a special identification of disputed areas.

``` r
india_pak <- gb_get_adm0(c("India", "Pakistan"))

# Disputed area: Kashmir
ggplot(india_pak) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = shapeName), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FF671F", "#00401A")) +
  labs(
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Map of India & Pakistan",
    subtitle = "Note overlapping in Kashmir region",
    caption = "Source: www.geoboundaries.org"
  )
```

Note that individual data files are governed by the license or licenses
identified within the metadata for each respective boundary.

``` r
gb_get_metadata(c("India", "Pakistan"), adm_lvl = "ADM0") %>%
  select(boundaryName, boundaryLicense, boundarySource)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   boundaryName boundaryLicense                                    boundarySource
#>   <chr>        <chr>                                              <chr>         
#> 1 India        CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedicat… geoBoundaries…
#> 2 Pakistan     Open Data Commons Open Database License 1.0        OpenStreetMap…
```

### Composite files

If you would prefer data that explicitly includes disputed areas, please
use [`gb_get_world()`](../reference/gb_get_world.md). This function
downloads global composite datasets for administrative boundaries, also
known as CGAZ (Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones). There are
three important distinctions between CGAZ and individual country
downloads:

1.  Extensive simplification is performed to ensure that file sizes are
    small enough to be used in most traditional desktop software.

2.  Disputed areas are removed and replaced with polygons following US
    Department of State definitions.

3.  Gaps between borders have been filled.

``` r
cgaz_india_pak <- gb_get_world(c("India", "Pakistan"))

ggplot(cgaz_india_pak) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = shapeName), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FF671F", "#00401A")) +
  labs(
    fill = "Country",
    title = "Map of India & Pakistan",
    subtitle = "CGAZ does not overlap",
    caption = "Source: www.geoboundaries.org"
  )
```

## Caching and performance

The package provides a built-in mechanism to cache files locally so that
repeated downloads for the same country/level will use the cached
version. For example:

``` r
# Current folder
current <- gb_get_cache()

current
#> [1] "C:\\Users\\RUNNER~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmp4S1Qww"

# Change to new
newdir <- file.path(tempdir(), "/geoboundvignette")
gb_set_cache(newdir)
#> ✔ rgeoboundaries cache directory is 'C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp4S1Qww//geoboundvignette'.
#> ℹ To install your `path` for use in future sessions run this function with `install = TRUE`.

# Download
example <- gb_get_adm0("Vatican City", quiet = FALSE)
#> ℹ Downloading file from <https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/raw/9469f09/releaseData/gbOpen/VAT/ADM0/geoBoundaries-VAT-ADM0-all.zip>
#> → Cache dir is 'C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp4S1Qww//geoboundvignette/gbOpen'

gb_list_cache()
#> [1] "gbOpen/geoBoundaries-VAT-ADM0-all.zip"

# Restore cache dir
gb_set_cache(current)
#> ✔ rgeoboundaries cache directory is 'C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp4S1Qww'.
#> ℹ To install your `path` for use in future sessions run this function with `install = TRUE`.

current == gb_get_cache()
#> [1] TRUE
```

Specific cache directories on each function call can be set using the
`path` argument of each function.

## Use in spatial analysis pipelines

Because the boundaries are returned as **sf** objects, you can easily
use them in combination with other spatial data:

- Clip raster data to administrative units
- Compute zonal statistics
- Create choropleth maps
- Perform spatial joins with survey or tabular data

In this example we would create a choropleth map using the meta data of
the individual files and the boundaries data of CGAZ:

``` r
# Metadata

latam_meta <- gb_get_metadata(adm_lvl = "ADM0") %>%
  select(boundaryISO, boundaryName, Continent, worldBankIncomeGroup) %>%
  filter(Continent == "Latin America and the Caribbean") %>%
  glimpse()
#> Rows: 47
#> Columns: 4
#> $ boundaryISO          <chr> "ABW", "AIA", "ARG", "ATG", "BES", "BHS", "BLM", …
#> $ boundaryName         <chr> "Aruba", "Anguilla", "Argentina", "Antigua and Ba…
#> $ Continent            <chr> "Latin America and the Caribbean", "Latin America…
#> $ worldBankIncomeGroup <chr> "High-income Countries", "No income group availab…

# Adjust factors
latam_meta$income_factor <- factor(latam_meta$worldBankIncomeGroup,
  levels = c(
    "High-income Countries",
    "Upper-middle-income Countries",
    "Lower-middle-income Countries",
    "Low-income Countries"
  )
)

# Get the shapes from CGAZ
latam_sf <- gb_get_world(adm_lvl = "ADM0") %>%
  inner_join(latam_meta,
    by =
      c("shapeGroup" = "boundaryISO")
  )

ggplot(latam_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = income_factor)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens", direction = -1) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(position = "bottom", nrow = 2)) +
  coord_sf(
    crs = "+proj=laea +lon_0=-75 +lat_0=-15"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "World Bank Income Group",
    subtitle = "Latin America and the Caribbean",
    fill = "",
    caption = "Source: www.geoboundaries.org"
  )
```

## Summary

The **rgeoboundaries** package makes it easy to fetch, manage and
visualize administrative boundary data worldwide in a reproducible and
efficient way. Whether you’re doing mapping, spatial analysis, survey
integration or geospatial modelling, it gives you a high-quality
boundary dataset with minimal overhead.
