# Retrieve metadata of individual country files from geoBoundaries

This function returns metadata of the [geoBoundaries
API](https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html).

## Usage

``` r
gb_get_metadata(
  country = "all",
  adm_lvl = "all",
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative")
)
```

## Source

geoBoundaries API Service <https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html>.

## Arguments

- country:

  Character vector of country identifiers. This can be `"all"` (to
  return data for all countries), a vector of country names, or ISO3
  country codes. See also
  [`countrycode::countrycode()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/reference/countrycode.html).

- adm_lvl:

  Type of boundary to retrieve. Accepted values are `"all"` (all
  available administrative levels) or a specific ADM level. `"adm0"`
  corresponds to country boundaries, `"adm1"` to first-level subnational
  boundaries, `"adm2"` to second-level boundaries, and so on. Uppercase
  variants (e.g. `"ADM1"`) and numeric values (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`,
  `5`) are also accepted.

- release_type:

  One of `"gbOpen"`, `"gbHumanitarian"`, or `"gbAuthoritative"`. For
  most users, `"gbOpen"` (the default) is recommended, as it is CC-BY
  4.0 compliant and suitable for most purposes provided proper
  attribution is given:

  - `"gbHumanitarian"` files are mirrored from [UN
    OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/) and may have more restrictive
    licensing.

  - `"gbAuthoritative"` files are mirrored from UN SALB and cannot be
    used for commercial purposes, but are verified through in-country
    processes.

## Value

A [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl_df-class.html).

## Details

The result is a
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl_df-class.html) with
the following columns:

- `boundaryID`: The ID for this layer, which is a combination of the ISO
  code, the boundary type, and a unique identifier for the boundary
  generated based on the input metadata and geometry. This only changes
  if the underlying data changes.

- `boundaryName`: The name of the country the layer represents.

- `boundaryISO`: ISO-3166-1 (Alpha 3) code for the country.

- `boundaryYearRepresented`: The year, or range of years in
  `"START to END"` format, which the boundary layers represent.

- `boundaryType`: The type of boundary.

- `boundaryCanonical`: The canonical name of a given boundary.

- `boundarySource`: A comma-separated list of the primary sources for
  the boundary.

- `boundarySource`: A comma-separated list of the primary sources for
  the boundary.

- `boundaryLicense`: The original license that the dataset was released
  under by the primary source.

- `licenseDetail`: Any notes regarding the license.

- `licenseSource`: The URL of the primary source.

- `sourceDataUpdateDate`: The date the source information was integrated
  into the geoBoundaries repository.

- `buildDate`: The date the source data was most recently standardized
  and built into a geoBoundaries release.

- `Continent`: The continent the country is associated with.

- `UNSDG-region`: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
  region the country is associated with.

- `UNSDG-subregion`: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
  (SDG) subregion the country is associated with.

- `worldBankIncomeGroup`: The World Bank income group the country is
  associated with.

- `admUnitCount`: Count of administrative units in the file.

- `meanVertices`: Mean number of vertices defining the boundaries of
  each administrative unit in the layer.

- `minVertices`: Minimum number of vertices defining a boundary.

- `maxVertices`: Maximum number of vertices defining a boundary.

- `minPerimeterLengthKM`: The minimum perimeter length of an
  administrative unit in the layer, measured in kilometers (based on a
  World Equidistant Cylindrical projection).

- `meanPerimeterLengthKM`: The mean perimeter length of an
  administrative unit in the layer, measured in kilometers (based on a
  World Equidistant Cylindrical projection).

- `maxPerimeterLengthKM`: The maximum perimeter length of an
  administrative unit in the layer, measured in kilometers (based on a
  World Equidistant Cylindrical projection).

- `meanAreaSqKM`: The mean area of all administrative units in the
  layer, measured in square kilometers (based on a EASE-GRID 2
  projection).

- `minAreaSqKM`: The minimum area of an administrative unit in the
  layer, measured in square kilometers (based on a EASE-GRID 2
  projection).

- `maxAreaSqKM`: The maximum area of an administrative unit in the
  layer, measured in square kilometers (based on a EASE-GRID 2
  projection).

- `staticDownloadLink`: The static download link for the aggregate zip
  file containing all boundary information.

- `gjDownloadURL`: The static download link for the `geoJSON`.

- `tjDownloadURL`: The static download link for the `topoJSON`.

- `imagePreview`: The static download link for the automatically
  rendered `PNG` of the layer.

- `simplifiedGeometryGeoJSON`: The static download link for the
  simplified `geoJSON`.
