# Get the highest administrative level available for a given country

Get a summary of selected or all countries and their highest
administrative level available in geoBoundaries.

## Usage

``` r
gb_get_max_adm_lvl(
  country = "all",
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative")
)
```

## Source

geoBoundaries API Service <https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html>.

## Arguments

- country:

  A character vector of country codes. It could be either `"all"` (that
  would return the data for all countries), a vector of country names or
  ISO3 country codes. See also
  [`countrycode::countrycode()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/reference/countrycode.html).

- release_type:

  One of `"gbOpen"`, `"gbHumanitarian"`, `"gbAuthoritative"`. For most
  users, we suggest using `"gbOpen"` (the default), as it is CC-BY 4.0
  compliant and can be used for most purposes so long as attribution is
  provided:

  - `"gbHumanitarian"` files are mirrored from [UN
    OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/), but may have less open licensure.

  - `"gbAuthoritative"` files are mirrored from [UN
    SALB](https://salb.un.org/en), and cannot be used for commercial
    purposes, but are verified through in-country processes.

## Value

A tibble with class
[`tbl_df`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tbl_df-class.html)
with the country names and corresponding highest administrative level.
