# Get global composites data (CGAZ) from geoBoundaries

[Attribution](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#usage) is
required for all uses of this dataset.

This function returns a global composite of the required administration
level, clipped to international boundaries, with gaps filled between
borders.

## Usage

``` r
gb_get_world(
  country = "all",
  adm_lvl = "adm0",
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)
```

## Source

geoBoundaries API Service <https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html>.

## Arguments

- country:

  A character vector of country codes. It could be either `"all"` (that
  would return the data for all countries), a vector of country names or
  ISO3 country codes. See also
  [`countrycode::countrycode()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/reference/countrycode.html).

- adm_lvl:

  Type of boundary Accepted values are administrative levels 0, 1 and 2
  (`"adm0"` is the country boundary, `"adm1"` is the first level of sub
  national boundaries, `"adm2"` is the second level and so on. Upper
  case version (`"ADM1"`) and the number of the level (`0, 1, 2`) and
  also accepted.

- quiet:

  logical. If `TRUE` suppresses informational messages.

- overwrite:

  logical. When set to `TRUE` it would force a fresh download of the
  source `.zip` file.

- path:

  A path to a cache directory. If not set (the default `NULL`), the data
  would be stored in the default cache directory (see
  [`gb_set_cache()`](gb_cache.md)). If no cache directory has been set,
  files would be stored in the temporary directory (see
  [`base::tempdir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html)).

## Value

A [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) object.

## Details

Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones (CGAZ) is a set of global
composites for administrative boundaries. There are two important
distinctions between our global product and individual country
downloads.

- Extensive simplification is performed to ensure that file sizes are
  small enough to be used in most traditional desktop software.

- Disputed areas are removed and replaced with polygons following US
  Department of State definitions.
