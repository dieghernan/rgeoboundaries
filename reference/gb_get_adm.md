# Get country files from geoBoundaries for a given administration level

[Attribution](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html#usage) is
required for all uses of this dataset.

These functions are wrappers of [`gb_get()`](gb_get.md) for extracting
any given administration level:

- `gb_get_adm0()` returns the country boundary.

- `gb_get_adm1()` returns first-level administration boundaries (e.g.
  States in the United States).

- `gb_get_adm2()` returns second-level administration boundaries (e.g.
  Counties in the United States).

- `gb_get_adm3()` returns third-level administration boundaries (e.g.
  towns or cities in some countries).

- `gb_get_adm4()` returns fourth-level administration boundaries.

- `gb_get_adm5()` returns fifth-level administration boundaries.

Note that not all countries have the same number of levels. Check
[gb_get_max_adm_lvl](gb_get_max_adm_lvl.md).

## Usage

``` r
gb_get_adm0(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)

gb_get_adm1(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)

gb_get_adm2(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)

gb_get_adm3(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)

gb_get_adm4(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)

gb_get_adm5(
  country,
  simplified = FALSE,
  release_type = c("gbOpen", "gbHumanitarian", "gbAuthoritative"),
  quiet = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  path = NULL
)
```

## Source

geoBoundaries API Service <https://www.geoboundaries.org/api.html>.

## Arguments

- country:

  A character vector of country codes. It could be either `"all"` (that
  would return the data for all countries), a vector of country names or
  ISO3 country codes. See also
  [`countrycode::countrycode()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/reference/countrycode.html).

- simplified:

  logical. Return the simplified boundary or not. The default `FALSE`
  would use the premier geoBoundaries release.

- release_type:

  One of `"gbOpen"`, `"gbHumanitarian"`, `"gbAuthoritative"`. For most
  users, we suggest using `"gbOpen"` (the default), as it is CC-BY 4.0
  compliant and can be used for most purposes so long as attribution is
  provided:

  - `"gbHumanitarian"` files are mirrored from [UN
    OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/), but may have less open licensure.

  - `"gbAuthoritative"` files are mirrored from [UN
    SALB](https://salb.un.org/en), and cannot be used for commercial
    purposes, but are verified through in-country processes.

- quiet:

  logical. If `TRUE` suppresses informational messages.

- overwrite:

  logical. When set to `TRUE` it would force a fresh download of the
  source `.zip` file.

- path:

  A path to a cache directory. If not set (the default `NULL`), the data
  would be stored in the default cache directory (see
  [`gb_set_cache()`](gb_cache.md)). If no cache directory has been set,
  files would be stored in the temporary directory (see
  [`base::tempdir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html)).

## Value

A [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) object.

## Details

Individual data files in the geoBoundaries database are governed by the
license or licenses identified within the metadata for each respective
boundary (see [`gb_get_metadata()`](gb_get_metadata.md). Users using
individual boundary files from geoBoundaries should additionally ensure
that they are citing the sources provided in the metadata for each file.
